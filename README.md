# Unit Test Activity

> Activity to create a basic unit test from Week 7 of MIT xPro Full Stack Professional Certificate program.

### Activity Goals

##### First Goal:
Write a small function that takes in an input (of one or more names) and outputs a "Hello" type of greeting. The greeting will be formatted differently based on different input types. The greeting options are:

1. A default message that says "Hello there!" if no name is input.
2. A message that takes a singe name input and outputs, for example, "Hello, Elizabeth."
3. A message that takes in a "shouted" (all caps) name and returns a shouted greeting, example: "HELLO, JOSE!"
4. A message for two names input as an array, example: "Hello, Jesse, Franklin."
5. A message for an unlimited number of names inserted, example: "Hello, Max, Susan, Sarina, Abel."

##### Second Goal:
Write unit tests to succesfully test each condition required of the function. Use Jest as the testing platform.
